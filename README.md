Wisdom Cafe Website Deployment Instructions
This project is a single-file static HTML website. To deploy it correctly on Cloudflare Pages, you need to configure the build settings to serve the static files directly.

Files
index.html: The main website file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

wrangler.toml: The configuration file for Cloudflare Pages, which specifies that this is a static site.

Cloudflare Pages Configuration
Follow these steps to configure your Cloudflare Pages project for a successful deployment:

Navigate to your Pages project in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Go to the "Settings" tab, and then select "Build & deployments".

Under the "Build configuration" section, locate the following fields:

Build command: This should be empty. Cloudflare Pages automatically handles static site builds without a command. If there is a command here (e.g., npx wrangler deploy), remove it.

Build output directory: Change this value to a single dot .. This tells Cloudflare Pages to serve files directly from the root of your project.

Root directory: Ensure this is set to / (a single forward slash).

Click "Save".

After saving, trigger a new deployment from the Cloudflare Pages dashboard. The new build should now bypass the wrangler worker-specific command and successfully deploy your index.html file as a static site.
