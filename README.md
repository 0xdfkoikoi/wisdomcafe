Wisdom Cafe Website Deployment Instructions
This project is a single-file static HTML website. To deploy it correctly on Cloudflare Pages, you need to configure the build settings to serve the static files directly.

Files
index.html: The main website file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

wrangler.toml: The configuration file for Cloudflare Pages, which specifies that this is a static site.

Cloudflare Pages Configuration
Follow these steps to configure your Cloudflare Pages project for a successful deployment:

Navigate to your Pages project in the Cloudflare dashboard.

Go to the "Settings" tab, and then select "Build & deployments".

Under the "Build configuration" section, locate the following fields:

Build command: This field must be left completely empty. Cloudflare Pages automatically handles static site builds, and any command here (especially npx wrangler deploy) will cause it to look for a JavaScript Worker, which is why you are seeing the error.

Build output directory: Change this value to a single dot .. This tells Cloudflare Pages to serve files directly from the root of your project.

Root directory: Ensure this is set to / (a single forward slash).

Click "Save".

After saving, trigger a new deployment from the Cloudflare Pages dashboard. The new build should now bypass the wrangler worker-specific command and successfully deploy your index.html file as a static site.

Understanding the Deployment Error
The error message The entry-point file at "dist/index.js" was not found is a key indicator of a misconfiguration. It means that the deployment process is trying to build a Cloudflare Worker, which requires a specific JavaScript entry-point file (e.g., dist/index.js).

Since your project is a simple static site (a single HTML file), you do not need a build process or a JavaScript entry point. By leaving the Build command field empty in your Cloudflare Pages settings, you are telling the platform to simply serve your static files as-is, which is the correct approach.
